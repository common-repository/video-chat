A free video chat for your Wordpress.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a free video chat for your Wordpress installation, where each user can watch up to three high quality webcam streams simultaneously. The chat layout can be adjusted to match your site and brand, and you can set up moderator access for your room through Camamba.

Hosting and the flash application are courtesy of Camamba.com. The chat itself is ad supported. Optionally you can enable a "powered by" link, which would be greatly appreciated. :)

Remember, this version is a release candidate! Please report all bugs and compatibility issues to webmaster at camamba dot com!

== Installation ==

This plugin creates a widget. After activating the plugin, add it through the widgets menu under "appearance". Also check the plugin settings to configure the chats appearance.

From the settings page you can log into your chat as a moderator, but have to set that up at camamba.com first. There's a link above the moderator log in form.
